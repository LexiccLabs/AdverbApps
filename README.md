# MaaraaWeb
- MaaraaDAO is a collective of Anonymous Authentication based Advertisig App Engine ported to Substrate Systems



## Problem Statement
- All the existing protocols and services on today’s internet are fragmented and fragile. The advertisements are enmeshed in isolated zones. 

## Perspective
- in Web3 are built on permissionless blockchains with open protocols and open standards. 
- It allow for a much greater level of freedom, decentralization, and democracy for individual users, content creators, and projects.

## Technology
- Integration of MixNet Implementation in Rust ( https://github.com/nvotes/braid )
- Integration of ZKP Implementation on Substrate ( https://github.com/PlasmNetwork/ZKRollups )

## Inspiration
- Maaraa is the dravidian god of ancient species and spectres ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ra )
- The web 3.0 is also known as the “Semantic”,  thanks to semantic metadata for connectivity at large.
- The Web 3.0 is also known as “The trend of democratizing the internet.”
- Content is accessible by multiple applications, every device is connected to the web, the services can be used everywhere.

## What it does
- MaaraaWeb is an early ensemble of Polkadot Prototypes for the modern manifestation of semantic web


## How we built it
- Integration with Polkadot Substrate System
- Integration with Rust based Mixer Networks
