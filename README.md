## Primordial
- Maaraa is the dravidian god of ancient species and spectres ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ra )

## Pragma 
- MaaraaWeb is an early ensemble of Polkadot Prototypes for the modern manifestation of semantic web
- The web 3.0 is also known as the “Semantic”,  thanks to semantic metadata for connectivity at large.
- The Web 3.0 is also known as “The trend of democratizing the internet.”
- Content is accessible by multiple applications, every device is connected to the web, the services can be used everywhere.

## Problem Statement
- All the existing protocols and services on today’s internet, in Web3 are built on permissionless blockchains with open protocols and open standards. 
- It allow for a much greater level of freedom, decentralization, and democracy for individual users, content creators, and projects.
